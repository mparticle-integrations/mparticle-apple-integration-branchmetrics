        //     - User does not tap on a link, and then opens the app (either after a fresh install or not)
        //     - This block will be invoked with Branch Metrics' response indicating that this user did not tap on a link.
        //
        // (2) Deferred deep link:
        //     - User without the app installed taps on a link
        //     - User is redirected from Branch Metrics to the App Store and installs the app
        //     - User opens the app
        //     - This block will be invoked with Branch Metrics' response containing the details of the link
        //
        // (3) Deep link with app installed:
        //     - User with the app already installed taps on a link
        //     - Application opens via openUrl/continueUserActivity, mParticle forwards launch options etc to Branch
        //     - This block will be invoked with Branch Metrics' response containing the details of the link
        //
        // If the user navigates away from the app without killing it, this block could be invoked several times:
        // once for the initial launch, and then again each time the user taps on a link to re-open the app.
